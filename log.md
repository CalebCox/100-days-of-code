# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Map the Debris excercise on FreeCodeCamp and started Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts** I'm glad to finally be back into coding and hope to get a better grasp on Javascript than I previously had.

### Day 3: August 31, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finalized all functionality of my Pomodoro clock.

**Thoughts** Learned quite a bit about Intervals. Really enjoyed challenging myself to complete the JS side of this without using jQuery or any other framework/library for help. On to styling!

**Updated later in the day**: Had to finished the Pomodoro clock, couldn't wait! Added a link to the completed clock on Codepen below.
