# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Map the Debris excercise on FreeCodeCamp and started Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts** I'm glad to finally be back into coding and hope to get a better grasp on Javascript than I previously had.

### Day 2: August 30, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated stylesheet for my Pomodoro Clock and added UI functionality and timer to the clock.

**Thoughts** Really need to get a better grasp on certain JS functions and operators.

### Day 3: August 31, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finalized all functionality of my Pomodoro clock.

**Thoughts** Learned quite a bit about Intervals. Really enjoyed challenging myself to complete the JS side of this without using jQuery or any other framework/library for help. On to styling!

**Updated later in the day**: Had to finished the Pomodoro clock, couldn't wait! Added a link to the completed clock on Codepen below.

### Day 4: September 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Pairwise Algorithm challenge, which was my last algorithm challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Started the Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts**: While I'm glad to have moved to the next project and to have completed all the algorithm challenges I feel I didn't get as much done today as I could have.

### Day 5: September 2, Saturday
  
  **Today's progress**: Setup the stylesheet and layout for the Tic Tac Toe board.
  
  **Thoughts**: Again today I was unable to put more work in outside of the required hour. I feel the past two days i've made very little to no progress to show.

### Day 6: September 3, Sunday
  
  **Today's progress**: Updated stylesheet to fix display issues once text was added to each cell. Started playing with functionality.
  
  **Thoughts**: Another slow day again today due to some hiccups I found with my stylesheet after adding user inputs. I'll have to re-work the entiretly of my JS so it isn't the same repeated code (DRY). Will get back to this tomorrow with fresh eyes.

### Day 7: September 4, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored my Tic Tac Toe project for better functionality and DRY code. Also, made a simple Weight Watchers SmartPoints calculator after it was brought to my attention the current calculator doesnt allow for numbers over 1000 to be input for tracking.

**Thoughts**: Glad to have finally made some decent progress on my Tic Tac Toe project. Just need to get the AI working and it should be completed. Had fun tackling the Weight Watchers algorithm too.

### Day 8: September 5, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: No major coding progress made, studied Minimax and Recursion to get a better understanding of both in order to start on AI for the Tic Tac Toe Project.

**Thoughts**: Really bummed I didn't have any code to commit today after numerous failed tests. Although, I am glad to have taken to time to research a new topic.

### Day 9: September 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progess**: Continued to study AI algorithms and mechanics for zero-sum games such as Alpha-Beta and Deep Blue to get a stronger foundation of AI.

**Thoughts**: Similar to yesterday, no code to commit or show for work due to failed testing and time spent watching resources.

### Day 10: September 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Re-approached my Tic Tac Toe game and implemented a basic AI, I was unable to fully grasp how to implement minimax or alpha beta pruning but I wante to make progress and commit code. Got the AI and game functionality compeleted!

**Thoughts**: While I don't have the smart unbeatable AI that I would like to have, my game is functional and completed enough to publish to Codepen. I can always come back and re-visit it once I've learned a bit more about AI. I'm happy with the results.

### Day 11: September 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started on the Simon game project. Fleshed out the HTML layout, CSS and started on functionality.

**Thoughts**: I actually had an approach in mind for this project prior to finishing the Tic Tac Toe project. I thought it would be easier, and while I'm off to a great start I'm running into some hurdles that I wasn't anticipating, but such is life!
