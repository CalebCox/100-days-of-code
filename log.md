# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Map the Debris excercise on FreeCodeCamp and started Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts** I'm glad to finally be back into coding and hope to get a better grasp on Javascript than I previously had.

### Day 3: August 31, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finalized all functionality of my Pomodoro clock.

**Thoughts** Learned quite a bit about Intervals. Really enjoyed challenging myself to complete the JS side of this without using jQuery or any other framework/library for help. On to styling!

**Updated later in the day**: Had to finished the Pomodoro clock, couldn't wait! Added a link to the completed clock on Codepen below.

### Day 4: September 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Pairwise Algorithm challenge, which was my last algorithm challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Started the Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts**: While I'm glad to have moved to the next project and to have completed all the algorithm challenges I feel I didn't get as much done today as I could have.

  ### Day 5: September 2, Saturday
  
  **Today's progress**: Setup the stylesheet and layout for the Tic Tac Toe board.
  
  **Thoughts**: Again today I was unable to put more work in outside of the required hour. I feel the past two days i've made very little to no progress to show.

    ### Day 6: September 3, Sunday
  
  **Today's progress**: Updated stylesheet to fix display issues once text was added to each cell. Started playing with functionality.
  
  **Thoughts**: Another slow day again today due to some hiccups I found with my stylesheet after adding user inputs. I'll have to re-work the entiretly of my JS so it isn't the same repeated code (DRY). Will get back to this tomorrow with fresh eyes.
