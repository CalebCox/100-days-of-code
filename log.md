### Day 3: August 31, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finalized all functionality of my Pomodoro clock.

**Thoughts** Learned quite a bit about Intervals. Really enjoyed challenging myself to complete the JS side of this without using jQuery or any other framework/library for help. On to styling!

**Updated later in the day**: Had to finished the Pomodoro clock, couldn't wait! Added a link to the completed clock on Codepen below.

### Day 4: September 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Pairwise Algorithm challenge, which was my last algorithm challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Started the Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts**: While I'm glad to have moved to the next project and to have completed all the algorithm challenges I feel I didn't get as much done today as I could have.

### Day 5: September 2, Saturday
  
  **Today's progress**: Setup the stylesheet and layout for the Tic Tac Toe board.
  
  **Thoughts**: Again today I was unable to put more work in outside of the required hour. I feel the past two days i've made very little to no progress to show.

### Day 6: September 3, Sunday
  
  **Today's progress**: Updated stylesheet to fix display issues once text was added to each cell. Started playing with functionality.
  
  **Thoughts**: Another slow day again today due to some hiccups I found with my stylesheet after adding user inputs. I'll have to re-work the entiretly of my JS so it isn't the same repeated code (DRY). Will get back to this tomorrow with fresh eyes.

### Day 7: September 4, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored my Tic Tac Toe project for better functionality and DRY code. Also, made a simple Weight Watchers SmartPoints calculator after it was brought to my attention the current calculator doesnt allow for numbers over 1000 to be input for tracking.

**Thoughts**: Glad to have finally made some decent progress on my Tic Tac Toe project. Just need to get the AI working and it should be completed. Had fun tackling the Weight Watchers algorithm too.

### Day 8: September 5, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: No major coding progress made, studied Minimax and Recursion to get a better understanding of both in order to start on AI for the Tic Tac Toe Project.

**Thoughts**: Really bummed I didn't have any code to commit today after numerous failed tests. Although, I am glad to have taken to time to research a new topic.

### Day 9: September 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progess**: Continued to study AI algorithms and mechanics for zero-sum games such as Alpha-Beta and Deep Blue to get a stronger foundation of AI.

**Thoughts**: Similar to yesterday, no code to commit or show for work due to failed testing and time spent watching resources.

### Day 10: September 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Re-approached my Tic Tac Toe game and implemented a basic AI, I was unable to fully grasp how to implement minimax or alpha beta pruning but I wante to make progress and commit code. Got the AI and game functionality compeleted!

**Thoughts**: While I don't have the smart unbeatable AI that I would like to have, my game is functional and completed enough to publish to Codepen. I can always come back and re-visit it once I've learned a bit more about AI. I'm happy with the results.

### Day 11: September 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started on the Simon game project. Fleshed out the HTML layout, CSS and started on functionality.

**Thoughts**: I actually had an approach in mind for this project prior to finishing the Tic Tac Toe project. I thought it would be easier, and while I'm off to a great start I'm running into some hurdles that I wasn't anticipating, but such is life!

### Day 12: September 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get much updated in the way of my Simon game. Studied intervals a bit to get a better understanding of the issue I was having with my addClass/removeClass timer. Assisted a friend with a Introduction to Programming Logic lab they had for school.

**Thoughts**: While I didn't make any progress to show today, the fact that I was able to assist someone else with a problem they were having allowed me to see how far I've come and how much I've leard since starting FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 13: September 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Tested out some changes to my timer function with no results. I feel I should attempt to start from scratch on my Javascript and try a different approach.

**Thoughts**: I've gotten stumped a bit more than I had originally anticipated but I feel after re-approaching this I should be able to overcome the hurdles I've encountered.

### Day 14: September 11, Monday

**Today's Progress**: After looking at other possible approaches to the Simon game I've found that using Objects might be a better approach versus how I was previously handling the game logic. I refactored my code (actually started from scratch) using this new approach and was able to overcome the hurdle and complete the Simon project. This also means I've completed the FreeCodeCamp Front-End certification!!

**Thoughts**: I'm very excited to have my past experiences gratified with the certificate and knowing based on Day 12's experience that I can speak to what I've learned. I'm even more excited to continue on from this point and learn even further!

### Day 15: September 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the Back-End coursework for FreeCodeCamp and got through how-to-npm and learnyounode. Also started back up on Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp (I finished the front end section but waited to start the back-end until my FreeCodeCamp progress caught up). After user feedback, I updated my Simon game to be less "intrusive" by removing game status Alerts and replacing them with an h2 that updates based on game state.

**Thoughts**: Glad to get moving and have the confidence to go back and revisit older projects and improve upon them.

### Day 16: September 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Node.js section and started Express.js on FreeCodeCamp, continued Colt Steele's web dev bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: No code to commit today but wrapping my brain around this back end framework has been quite the change of pace from the previous front end work i've done.

### Day 17: September 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Express.js and Git sections of FreeCodeCamp's back-end track. Continued through to the intermediate section of Colt Steele's Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: Next step on FCC is MongoDB, I'll probably hold off on that until after I complete the Udemy courses Express.js sections. Might re-visit my Tic Tac Toe project to refactor it for minimax.

### Day 18: September 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning Express.js, re-visited API's and started on a Yelp clone for practice.

**Thoughts**: Continuing to push through Colt Steele's course. Contemplating re-visiting my own portfolio site and giving it a facelift as well. Need code to commit!

### Day 19: September 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Express.js section from the Web Dev Bootcamp and started styling on the Yelp clone. Started learning about MongoDB.

**Thoughts**: Now that I'm at MongoDB on the Web Dev Bootcamp I can start working on FCC again. I'm going to get a bit ahead on the Udemy course before re-starting FCC. I've also found that I can continue the Data Visualization certification via FCC Beta.

### Day 20: September 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the MongoDB section on FreeCodeCamp and Colt Steele's Udemy course. Finished and committed the Timestamp Microservice project for FCC.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled to complete and fully understand the Timestamp project. I feel like I should have easily gotten through this given the prior experience I've had. I'll be considering a further deep dive into Node and EJS, specifically GET and POST requests to try and remedy this issue.

### Day 21: September 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the Beta FreeCodeCamp API/Node/Express track as it goes a bit more into detail. Trying to gain a better understanding of Node and Express.

**Thoughts**: I'm still struggling to understand how Node and Express functions between front end and back end. I'm sure I'm probably just overcomplicating things.

### Day 22: September 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Decided to re-visit my TicTacToe project to refactor the JS and implement minimax, I plan to add a difficulty selection as well as a player vs player option.

**Thoughts**: I planned to re-visit this project eventually but am doing it now as I feel due to the Node/Express tracks I'm working I have no code to commit, also, given my struggles with the back end I wanted to take a step back and work on something else and re-approach Node and Express with fresh eyes.

### Day 23: September 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Went through some Mongoose excercises for Colt Steeles Udemy course, read through the Twitch Extensions developer documentation and completed the Request Header Parser project for FreeCodeCamp's Back-End cert.

**Thoughts**: Today was a pretty busy day, I feel like I made a lot of progress and have a positive outlook moving onto the next challenge.

### Day 24: September 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through Colt Steeles Udemy course and it's MongoDB and Mongoose section.

**Thoughts**: After looking into the User Stories and cases for the next FCC backend project I've found I'll need a better grasp of MongoDB to properly complete this next challenge and have put FCC on hold until I get a bit more knowledge in that area frmo the Udemy course I'm currently going through.
